# Intermittent 500 Errors in Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a scenario where a Node.js server intermittently returns a 500 Internal Server Error without providing clear error messages in the console.  The root cause is subtle and related to asynchronous operations.

## Bug Description

The server appears to function correctly for a while but after a period of inactivity, requests start to fail with a 500 error.  Standard error logging doesn't reveal the source of the problem.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send requests to the server. After some time of inactivity, you will likely encounter 500 errors. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully handling asynchronous operations and implementing robust error handling.  See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code. 

## Lessons Learned

*   Thorough asynchronous error handling is crucial in Node.js.
*   Use tools like logging and monitoring to track down intermittent errors.
*   Understanding the behavior of async/await is key to avoiding unexpected issues.
